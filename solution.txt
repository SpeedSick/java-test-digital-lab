The following solution is used to solve this task:

1) Floyd algorithm, to calculate the shortest distances between two nodes of the given graph 
2) Dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of paths between two nodes with given steps
	dp[from][to][steps] -- returns the number of paths
3) Dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of paths between two nodes with given distance
	dp[from][to][distance] -- returns the number of paths
